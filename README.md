This repository contains the code for my personal website, which is built on NodeJS, Express-Handlebars and Bootstrap.

---

When I am testing on my local machines, I have a different form of the app.js file, that is designed to serve some local server certificates so that I can test over an SSL secure connection to ensure that everything is working as intended (since the production site is served securely).  This version of the file is not included in the repository,nor are the server certificate files.  If you wish to, for some reason, run this site over SSL on a local machine, I followed the instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21397809/create-a-trusted-self-signed-ssl-cert-for-localhost-for-use-with-express-node/42298344#42298344) - yes, I do my main development for the site on my MacBook. 

I encourage anyone to submit pull requests to fix issues, improve the code, etc.
