This repository contains the code for my personal website, which is built on NodeJS, Express-Handlebars and Bootstrap.

---

This site undergoes updates from time to time, mostly in back-end functionality. I am not big on front-end development, and so I tend to stick to the stuff I find more fun to work on, which is back-end development. I am currently in the process of learning React and Angular, and am hoping to incorporate that into the site down the line.

I encourage anyone to submit pull requests to fix issues, improve the code, etc.
