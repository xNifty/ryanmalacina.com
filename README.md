This repository contains the code for my personal website, which is built on NodeJS, Express-Handlebars and Bootstrap.

---

I actively maintain this site, adding, updating, and removing features as needed.  I am actively learning more about NodeJS, MongoDB, and Express while beginning to dive into the MEAN stack that I hope
to eventually make use of here (I would like to add Angular/React to this site where I can).

I encourage anyone to submit pull requests to fix issues, improve the code, etc.
