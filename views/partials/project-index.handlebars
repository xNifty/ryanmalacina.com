    <p>Welcome to my projects listing page!  Coming soon, you'll be able to click a project name and load information
        about that project, including a link to the project source code.  Unfortunately, the backend for this page
        is not yet completed so the project listing is not yet working.</p>
    {{!-- TODO: this needs to be loaded from the database, or maybe
          we should hardcode this page and just load the project details themselves
          and that should be enough...need to think about this more. For now, I'll hardcode this page and just
          load the project details from the database.  Overhaul possible later.
