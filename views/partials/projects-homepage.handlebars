    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>I work on multiple different projects in my free time, some of which are completed, and others that are
    simply basic ideas that I started but may not have finished.  Below are some of the projects I have worked on, am working on
    or have contributed to.  To view a list of all projects I have worked on you can click <a href="projects">here</a>.</p>
