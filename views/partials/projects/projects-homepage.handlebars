    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>I work on multiple different projects in my free time, some of which are completed, and others that are
    simply basic ideas that I started but may not have finished.  While I only show three projects here on the home page, there are currently
    {{ project_count }} projects that I have listed. To view a list of all projects I have worked on you can click <a href="projects">here</a>.</p>
